# SudokuSolver
## Description
* Implements Knuth's Dancing Links and Algorithm X to solve Sudoku for all solutions.
* Input on STDIN 81 space-seperated numbers [0-9] with 0 signifying an empty sudoku cell.
* SudokuSolver will output all possible solutions to the input puzzle.
	* Comment out `solved = true;` in `solve()` of `DLX.cpp` to do so as it currently prints a single solution.
	* TODO: Implement command line arguments for the user to specify output format.
